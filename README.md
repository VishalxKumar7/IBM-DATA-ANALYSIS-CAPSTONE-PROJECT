Overview
This project involves a comprehensive process of data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from web data and present them in an easily understandable format. Below is a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in this project.

Project Steps
1. Data Web Scraping
Objective: Collect data from relevant websites.

Tools Used: Python libraries BeautifulSoup.

Process:

Identified target websites and specific data points to scrape.

Wrote scripts to automate the data extraction process.

Stored the scraped data in CSV file.

2. Data Cleaning and Data Analysis
Objective: Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning and transforming it.

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Jupyter Notebook.

Process:

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies.

Transformed data types and normalized data where necessary.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.

3. Data Visualization
Objective: Visualize the cleaned data to identify trends and patterns.

Tools Used: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.

Visualizations Created:

Bar Graphs: To compare different categories.

Histograms: To show the distribution of numerical data.

Scatter Plots: To identify relationships between variables.

4. Dashboard Creation using IBM Cognos Analytics
Objective: Create an interactive dashboard to present the findings.

Tools Used: IBM Cognos Analytics.

Process:

Imported the cleaned and analyzed data into IBM Cognos Analytics.

Designed and configured interactive dashboards with various widgets and filters.

Ensured the dashboard is user-friendly and provides actionable insights.

5. PowerPoint Presentation and Insights
Objective: Summarize the findings and present them in a professional format.

Tools Used: Microsoft PowerPoint.

Process:

Created slides to outline the project steps, methodologies, and key findings.

Included visualizations and dashboards in the presentation.

Prepared insights and recommendations based on the data analysis.
